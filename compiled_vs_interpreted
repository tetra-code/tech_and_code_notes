# Language vs Implementation
First off, interpreted/compiled is not a property of the language but a property of the implementation.

# Compiled language vs Interpreted language
A **compiled language** is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An **interpreted language** is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.

Normally compiled languages compile directly to the native machine's code. But the compile process in interpreted langauges compiles to a byte code that is used by a vritual machine. This virtual machine (or the interpeter) later converts to the machine code

# Ahead-of-time vs Just-in-time
A JIT compiler can be faster because the machine code is being generated on the exact machine that it will also execute on.
