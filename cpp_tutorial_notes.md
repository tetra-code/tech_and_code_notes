# 0. Introduction

## C++ and CPP origins
C++ is one of the successors of C. Before C, most OS were written in Assembly. C was much better than Assembly and thus replaced as the de facto low level programming language for engineers. However, it lacked certain features as the tech market grew, the main being OOP construct. That is where C++ came in. C++ is also known as "C with class" and it was developed on Unix. C++ is perhaps best thought of as a superset of C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in C++).

The plus symbols can't be used in some situations, like in file names. Thus C++ is also known as CPP. File extensions that has .cpp are built with C++ source code. DOS and Windows C++ compilers use this file extension.

## Application
C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:

- Video games
- Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…
- High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
- Graphical applications and simulations
- Productivity / office applications
- IOT embedded software
- Audio and video processing
- Artificial intelligence and neural networks

In computer graphics, computer generated media tends to be structured, opposite of random and chaotic real life things.
CPP is also the GNU pre-processor.

## C++ compiling
In order to compile a C++ program, we use a C++ compiler. The C++ compiler sequentially goes through each source code in the **.cpp** file in your program. The compiler checks for errors and whether the source code compiles. Afterwards it translates the source code into a machine language file, called *object file*. Object files are typically named name.o or name.obj.

## Linker 
After the compiler creates one or more object files, then another program called the linker kicks in. The job of the linker is three fold:
1. Take all the object files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single executable program.
2. Link core and external libraries.
3. Make sure all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly

## Library
C++ also comes with an extensive library called the C++ Standard Library (usually shortened to standard library) that provides additional functionality that you can use in your programs. One of the most commonly used parts of the C++ standard library is the **iostream** library, which contains functionality for printing text on a monitor and getting keyboard input from a user. 

Almost every C++ program written utilizes the standard library in some form, so it’s very common for the standard library to get linked into your programs. Most linkers will automatically link in the standard library as soon as you use any part of it, so this generally isn’t something you need to worry about.

## IDE
Install an IDE that comes with the latest C++ compiler. If not make sure it is at least has a C++17 capable compiler.

## Build Configuration
A build configuration or build target are configuration settings that determines how your project will be built. This includes basic things such as:

- name of executable file
- directories for IDE to look for libraries
- keep or strip debugging information
- level of optimization the compiler should check for

It is normally best to leave these at the default settings. There are two types of build configurations:

- Release configuration
- Debug configuration

Release configuration are settings to release code in production. Strips all debugging information but includes all the optimization methods for performance and size. Useful for performance testing the application in production. 
Debug configuration are settings to help debug your program. Turns off all optimization methods and includes the debugging information. This makes the program larger and slower but easier to debug. The debugging information is quite big and the difference between including and excluding it is quite substantial.

The build configuration type can easily be switched at the tool bar of your IDE which is usually at the top middle.

## Compiler Configuration

### Compiler Extensions
The standard C++ defines rules about how programs should behave in specific circumstances. While compilers follow these instructions most of the times, sometimes they will implement their own changes to the language. The purpose is to enhance compatibility with other versions of the language (e.g. C99). These compiler specific behaviors are called *compiler extensions*.

When you write a program with the compiler extension enabled, the program will be incompatible with the C++ standard. Programs that make use of non-standard extensions generally will not compile on other compilers that don't support these extensions. Even if they do, they may not run correectly. 

Keep in mind that compiler extensions are enabled by default. Thus unless you have a specific reason to use a certain compiler extension, they are not recommnded as they are non-compliant with C++ standards. They should be turned off at the start of the project. This will allow the program to be compliant with C++ standards and work on any system.

### Warning and Errors
If you have turned the compiler extensions off, the compiler will check if you follow the standard C++ rules. The compiler will search and identitfy and errors you make. In some cases, the compiler may find code that seems like it might be an error but not sure. This will issue a warning instead of an error, as there is a motto **trust the programmer**, which states that the compiler shouldn't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done. Typos can also register as warnings but serious errors can also be warnings so don't ignore them. 

There are ways in IDE to temporarily disable warnings but this is not recommended.

The warning level can be raised or lowered, meaning the compiler will be more sensitive or more relaxed when identifying possible errors. When starting out C++, it is best to set the level to max to help identify possible issues. You can also configure the compiler to treat warnings as errors. This is a good way to enforce programmers to fix all warnings, which many don't.

## C++ variations
There are many different versions of C++ (C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, etc…). Your compiler will generally pick a standard to set as default. This is typically not the most recent language standard. To use a different language standard, you'll have to configure the IDE compiler to do so. 

Finalized language standards are named after the years in which they are finalized (e.g. C++17 was finalized in 2017). There are also in-progress language standards which are still in development and not clear in what year they will be finalized. For example, C++11 was caalled c++1x while it was under development.

In a professional environment, it is best to choose a language standard that is one or two versions back from the latest standard. As of this writing the latest version is C++20, thus you should choose C++14 or C++17. Several reasons to do this

- Compilers on some platforms may not provide full support for the latest standard right away
- Ensure the engineers have had the chance to fix any defects in the latest version 
- Allow best practices for new features to be discovered

In a learning environment, there is little downside to choosing the latest standard. 

As of the time of writing, Visual Studio 2022 defaults to C++14 capabilities, which does not allow for the use of newer features introduced in C++17 and C++20. To use these newer features, you’ll need to enable a newer language standard. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to do this globally -- you must do so on a project-by-project basis.

# 1. Basics

## Statement
A program is a sequence of instructions that tells the computer waht to do. A statement is a type of instruction that makes the program to do some action. 

Statements are the most common type of instruction in a C++ program. THey are the smallest unit of computation in C++. Most but not all statements in C++ end in a semicolon. Any line that ends in a semicolon is most likely a statement. 

This is in the context of C++. A single C++ statement may compile into dozens of machine language instructions.  

## main function
A function is a group of statements executed sequentially. A good developer will keep the size to a minimal and the logic as single as possible.

Just like Java, every C++ program must have a function called main. When the program is run all the statments inside of the main function are executed in sequential order. If the main function is absent from a program, it will compile but fail to build.

Example of main function in action:

    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
        return 0;
    }

There are quite a few syntax similarities to Java you see here.Some key terms to know from above:

- Line 1 is a special type of line called a **preprocessor directive**, indicates the use of **iostream** library contents
- Line 3 is the declaration of the main function, and indicates what type of data the function is returning
- Line 4 ~ 7 is the function body
- Line 5, 6 all have semicolons at the end, indiciating each of them are separate statements
- 

When compiled, the console will print the hello world statement and return 0.

## Comments
Comments exist soley for the programmer and devopers, as all comments are ignored by the compiler. Two types of comments:

- Single-line comments: begins with *//*. Typically used make a quick comment about a single line of code

Depending on the length, they can be either on the right side or the top of the code

- Multi-line comments: the /* and */ pair of symbols. Multi-line comments can't be nested.

Example:

    /* This is a multi-line comment.
    * the matching asterisks to the left
    * can make this easier to read
    */
