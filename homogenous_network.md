# Homogenous network
A network is homogenous if it uses a single network architecture and all machines use the same operating system. 

If in a LAN all machines are running Microsoft Windows OS, that network is homogenous.

# Heterogenous network
A network is heterogenous if it connects computers and devices where the OS and protocols are significantly diffent. 

If in a LAN the machines are a mix of Windows, MaxOS, and Linux then that network is homogenous.

Keep in mind most corporate networks are heterogenous networks due to
- limited budget makes it impossible to upgrade an older heterogenous network into newer homgenous network
- continuously evolving network operating system might make the current one outdated
- Replacing current network system with a new one might not be in best interest of company nor its users
- too attached to current system
