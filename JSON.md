# What is JSON
JSON is purely a string with a specified data format. To treat is a JSON object or dict object in other programming languages, we must first parse it.

JSON requires double quotes for property String name enclosing. Python is one of the few langauages that allow single quotes for String. Therefore, never use single quotes when creating dict objects that will be treated as JSON. It must be in double quotes to be loaded correctly.
