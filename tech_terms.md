## Turing Machine & Turing-complete
A Turing machine is a machine could answer any computational problem that could be expressed in code and that had a calculable answer. This means it should be able to run any algorithm or solve any computational problem, provided the necessary instructions, time, and meory are provided

A system of data-manipulation rules (programming languages) is considered Turing-complete if it can simulate a Turing machine. 

## Visual Studio vs Visual Studio Code
Main distinction between these editors is that Visual Studio is a full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE), while Visual Studio Code is a rich text editor. This primary difference sets them apart and is why you might choose one over the other. 

VSC is often used for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications, while VS can be used for desktop applications
VSC is cross platform editor, meaning it can run on all OS.

The primary reason why VS Code seems better in terms of usage in this debate of Visual Studio vs Visual Studio Code is that it offers incredible support, it can work across all platforms, and is lightweight and robust. It can do everything in just one place. VS Code comes with built-in support for JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript. If this is not enough, one can easily add the necessary support for languages like Python, C#, PHP, Java, and many more by installing their extensions.

Not many professionally developed plugins are available for Visual Studio. It is generally heavy, more suited for , and a bi tcostly.

VS Code, compared to Visual Studio, is pretty simple and smooth in terms of development experience. VS Code is pretty streamlined and straightforward, so a developer does not get tangled in any complexities.
Visual Studio Code is the best choice for web development. It offers incredible support with thousands of tools and extensions willing to work in your favour.

 Visual Studio is the best choice.

    Visual Studio is functionally feature-rich. In most cases, Visual Code matches the requirements of most developers perfectly without having to rely on further extensions or plugins.
    In Visual Studio, collaborating with your entire team is pretty easy when it comes to development as well as debugging code. The workflow is super-smooth and is loaded with all kinds of features one would need in the long run.
    When it comes to heavy-duty code analysis, debugging as well as performance profiling, Visual Studio is an incredible option.
    Visual Studio is pretty commonly used in the game development industry. For instance, UNITY, a multi-platform environment integrated with Visual Studio, can work effortlessly to build cross-platform mobile gaming applications, AR/VR applications, and more!

For a web developer, Most of its features are insignificant for some developers, no matter how great VS Code is. For them, Visual Studio is the best choice.  If your needs gravitate more towards .net development or C#, you should be looking forward to using Visual Studio. IDE will be excellent for your requirements.


## CUDA 
CUDA or Compute Unified Device Architeecture is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

## pgp
Use program called gpg for OpenPGP. It uses the concept of encrypting with a public key and decrypting with a private key. The sender uses the receiver's public key to encrypt the message. It cannot be decrypted by anyone except the receiver who possesses the corresponding private key

## Randomness
No matter how random an event is, there's always a confidence interval to be calculated. But this requires knowing the type of distribution beforehand. For example, earthquakes are regarded to have a pareto distribution.

## Talking
When you are on the side that supports change, explain the current flaws that is present without that change. Explain how the change can fix those flows. When you talk about an idea, be more explicit and convincing by showing real examples

## GNU
Recursive acronym for *GNU's Not Unix*, it is a collection of softwares that combines to function as an operating system or can be used along with another operating system. Most of GNU's software is licensed under GNU Project

Its design is Unix-like but differs from Unix being a free software and no Unix code. It uses the Microkernel or Monolithic kernel. 

Linux is based on GNU, with Linux's open source softwares built around the Linux Kernel. 

### Why use IDE
Developing your own program requires editing, compiling, linking, and dugging, all of which requires a software. While you can use separate programs for each of these activities, a software package known as an integrated development environment (IDE) bundles and integrates all of these features together.

## Unix or UNIX
Unix is a family of OS. Many OS systems like Linux and GNU follow Unix's design and principle. While Linux refers to a family of derived distros from the Linux Kernel, Unix refers to the orginal OS developed by AT&T. It is not opensource, unlike Linux.

Originally it was pure command based OS. Nowadays, most Unix distributions are shipped with a GUI desktop environment called Gnome. Is developed mainly for servers, workstations, and mainframes. 

The term *Unix-like* refers to OSs that behaves like a Unix system but not a direct variation of Unix.
 
Some Unix versions are SunOS, Solaris, SCO UNIX, AIX, HP/UX, ULTRIX, etc.

## Imperative Programming vs Functional Programming
Imperative programming is a paradigm where every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.
It also mutates the program's state.

Functional programming is a paradigm that considers computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Functional programming is composing the problem as a set of functions to be executed. Unlike IP it avoids changing state and mutable data.

## Interpreted vs Compiled languages
Interpretation are reading code line by line and then executed


Compilation are translated into binary code and then run

## Higher-order function
A function where another function is passed as a parameter or returns another function. Sca 

## CMake
CMake is an open-source, cross-platform software development tool that uses compiler-independent and platform-independent configuration files to generate native build tool files specific to your compiler and platform. It is used for build automation, testing, packaging and installing the software. It is not a build system itself but generates another system's build files. It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as Visual Studio, Make, Qt Creator, Ninja, Android Studio, Apple's Xcode, etc.
